Problem: Unique is making biscuits. She has a sheet of dough that is 12 inches by 12 inches. She makes square biscuits and each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches. How many biscuits can she make with this dough?
Model Response: 
The number of biscuits that can be made is 12.
12 inches by 12 inches is 144 square inches.
Each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches.
3 inches by 3 inches is 9 square inches.
144 square inches divided by 9 square inches is 16.
Therefore, 16 biscuits can be made.
Correct Answer: She has 144 square inches of dough because 12 times 12 equals <<12*12=144>>144.
Each biscuit uses 9 square inches of dough because 3 times 3 equals 9.
She can make 16 biscuits because 144 divided by 9 equals <<144/9=16>>16.

final_answer:  30
Problem: Oleg is an event organizer. He is organizing an event with 80 guests where 40 of them are men, half the number of men are women, and the rest are children. If he added 10 children to the guest list, how many children will there be at the event?
Model Response: 
Answer: 20 children
Let the total number of guests be x
The number of men = 40
The number of women = x - 40
The number of children = 10
Total number of guests = 80
Given that the number of men is 40, the number of women is x - 40 and the number of children is 10
80 = 40 + (x - 40) + 10
x = 80 - 40 - 10
x = 80 - 90
x = 10.
Hence, there are 20 children at the event.
Correct Answer: There are 40/2= <<40/2=20>>20 women at the event.
Hence, there are a total of 40 + 20 = <<40+20=60>>60 men and women at the event.
So, the total number of children at the event is 80 - 60 = <<80-60=20>>20.
After Oleg added 10 children to the guest list, there are a total of 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 children.

Problem: Sarah, Mary, and Tuan decided to go to the restaurant for a meal. They decided to split the cost of the meal evenly. If the total price of the meal comes to $67 and they have a coupon for $4, how much does each person need to contribute to the bill?
Model Response: 
It is given that the total cost of the meal is $67.
We know that the total cost of the meal is $67.
Therefore, the cost of the meal for each person is $67/3 = $22.33.
Since the cost of the meal for each person is $22.33, the amount that each person needs to contribute to the bill is $22.33.
Therefore, the amount that each person needs to contribute to the bill is $22.33.
Correct Answer: After using the coupon, the final price comes to 67 - 4 = <<67-4=63>>63 dollars.
With three people, they each need to pay 63 / 3 = <<63/3=21>>21 dollars each.

Correct Answer: To get the number of people at Taylor's party, we'll assume there were n people at his party.
The total number of people at Ryan's party is 4*n, four times the number of attendees at Taylor's party.
Combined, there were 4n+n = 240 people at both parties.
This translates to 5n=240.
The total number of people at Taylor's party is n=240/5
There were n=<<48=48>>48 people at Taylor's party.
Since Ryan's party was 4 times as huge as Taylor's party, at Ryan's party, there were 48*4 = <<48*4=192>>192 people.

Problem: Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, how many shirts does she have left?
Model Response: 
Let x = number of blue shirts
Let y = number of brown shirts
Then x + y = 26
And x/2 + y/3 = 36
x/2 = 36 - y/3
x = 36 - y/3
x - y/3 = 36
x - (y/3) = 36
x - y = 36 - (y/3)
x - y = 36 - y/3
x - y = 36 - y
x - y = 36
x - y = 26 - 36
x - y = -10
Therefore, Mary has 26 blue shirts and 36 brown shirts. If she gives away half of her blue shirts and a third of her brown shirts, she has 10 shirts left.
Note:
Correct Answer: Mary gives away 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 blue shirts.
Mary gives away 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 brown shirts.
Mary has 26-13 = <<26-13=13>>13 blue shirts left.

The correct answer is $25.
Annabelle collected a weekly allowance of $30. She spent a third of it buying junk food, then spent another $8 on sweets. Out of guilt she decides to save the rest.
How much did she save?
Let x represent the amount of money she saved.
She spent a third of it buying junk food, then spent another $8 on sweets.
She spent 1/3 of the $30 allowance on junk food.
1/3 x 30 = $10
She spent $8 on sweets.
8 + 10 = $18
She saved the rest of the $30 allowance.
x + 30 = $25
x = $25
Correct Answer: A third of $30 is $30*(1/3) = $<<30*(1/3)=10>>10
She spent $10 from $30 leaving $30-$10 = $20
She spent another $8 leaving $20-$8 = $<<20-8=12>>12 which she saved

I'm not sure what you mean by 100% of the games.  But, if you mean he plays in 80% of the games, then he will get 20 shots.  If you mean he plays in 100% of the games
Correct Answer: John plays in 20*.8=<<20*.8=16>>16 games
That means he gets fouled 16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 fouls
So he gets 80*2=<<80*2=160>>160 foul shots
So he makes 160*.7=<<160*.7=112>>112 free throws

{'generation': '\nLudwig earns $10 a day, so he earns $70 a week.'}
final_answer:  55
Problem: Ludwig works 7 days a week and he usually works half of the day during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. If his daily salary is $10, how much does he earn every week?
Model Response: 
Ludwig earns $10 a day, so he earns $70 a week.
Correct Answer: Ludwig earns a total of $10 x 4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from Monday to Thursday.
He earns $10/2= $<<10/2=5>>5 per day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
So, his total salary for Friday, Saturday, Sunday is $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
Therefore, his total weekly salary is $40 + $15 = $<<40+15=55>>55.

In total, Grant threw the ball 16+4 = <<16+4=20>>20 yards
Kyle threw 2 times farther than Grant so Kyle threw the ball 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40 yards

Problem: A farm is growing corn in 2 fields. One of the fields has 13 full rows of corn cobs, and the other field has 16 full rows of corn cobs. If each row contains 4 corn cobs, how many corn cobs has the farm grown?
Model Response: 
Answer: 208 corn cobs
Total number of rows in 2 fields = 13 + 16 = 29
Number of corn cobs in 1 row = 4
Total number of corn cobs = 4 x 29 = 116
Total number of corn cobs = 116 + 116 = 232
Total number of corn cobs = 232
Number of corn cobs = 232 / 2 = 116
A farm is growing corn in 2 fields. One of the fields has 13 full rows of corn cobs, and the other field has 16 full rows of corn cobs. If each row contains 4 corn cobs, how many corn cobs has the farm grown?
Correct Answer: In the first field, there are 13 rows * 4 corn cobs/row = <<13*4=52>>52 corn cobs.
In the second field, there are 16 rows * 4 corn cobs/row = <<16*4=64>>64 corn cobs.
So the farm has grown a total of 52 corn cobs + 64 corn cobs = <<52+64=116>>116 corn cobs.

Problem: Olga has three stripes on the side of each of her tennis shoes.  Rick has one less stripe per shoe than does Olga.  But Hortense has double the number of stripes on her tennis shoes as does Olga.  In total, what is the combined number of stripes on all of their pairs of tennis shoes?
Model Response: 

## Solution

$21$

## Proof

Let $x$ be the total number of stripes on Olga's shoes.

Let $y$ be the total number of stripes on Rick's shoes.

Let $z$ be the total number of stripes on Hortense's shoes.

We have:

$x + y = 3$

and

$y + z = 3$

but:

$x + z = 2$

So:

$x + y + z = 6$

So:

$x + y + z + x + y + z = 12$

and so:

$2x + y + z = 12$


Correct Answer: Rick has one less than three stripes, or 3-1=2 stripes on each tennis shoe.
Hortense has double the 3 stripes that Olga has, or a total of 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 stripes per shoe.
Since each of them has two tennis shoes per pair, then the total number of stripes on all of their shoes is 2*(3+2+6)=<<2*(3+2+6)=22>>22 stripes

You should be able to figure out how many pages will be crumpled, how many will be blurred, and how many will be neither.
It sounds like you're having trouble with the math, though.
Posted by Ms. Sue on 12/15/2010 at 07:38
I'm not sure what you mean
Correct Answer: First find the total number of pages that are crumpled: 42 pages / 7 = <<42/7=6>>6 pages
Then find the total number of pages that are blurred: 42 pages / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 pages
Then find the number of pages that are both blurred and crumpled by finding how many numbers are less or equal to 42 and divisible by both 3 and 7: there are two, 21 and 42.
Then subtract the number of crumpled and blurred pages from the total number of pages, and add the number of pages that were double-counted because they were both blurred and crumpled: 42 pages - 6 pages - 14 pages + 2 pages = <<42-6-14+2=24>>24 pages

Since they are adding 15 gallons every trip, to fill the 105-gallon pool, it would take 105 / 15 = <<105/15=7>>7 trips.

Problem: Grace started her own landscaping business. She charges $6 an hour for mowing lawns, $11 for pulling weeds and $9 for putting down mulch. In September she mowed lawns for 63 hours, pulled weeds for 9 hours and put down mulch for 10 hours. How much money did she earn in September?
Model Response: 
Grace mowed lawns for 63 hours, pulled weeds for 9 hours and put down mulch for 10 hours.
Grace started her own landscaping business.
She charges $6 an hour for mowing lawns, $11 for pulling weeds and $9 for putting down mulch.
In September she mowed lawns for 63 hours, pulled weeds for 9 hours and put down mulch for 10 hours.
Grace earned $63 for mowing lawns, $9 for pulling weeds and $90 for putting down mulch.
In September she earned $162.
How much money did she earn in September?
The number of hours worked for mowing lawns is 
Correct Answer: Grace mowed lawns for 63 hours at $6/hour, so earned 63 * 6 = $<<63*6=378>>378.
Grace pulled weeds for 9 hours at $11/hour, so earned 9 * 11 = $<<9*11=99>>99.
Grace put down mulch for 10 hours at $9/hour, so earned 10 * 9 = $<<10*9=90>>90.
During September Grace earned $378 + $99 + $90 = $<<378+99+90=567>>567.

Problem: There are six unicorns in the Enchanted Forest. Everywhere a unicorn steps, four flowers spring into bloom. The six unicorns are going to walk all the way across the forest side-by-side, a journey of 9 kilometers. If each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step, how many flowers bloom because of this trip?
Model Response: 
Let the unicorns walk at a rate of 1 meter per second.
The unicorns will be walking for 9 kilometers, so 9 kilometers / 1 meter per second = 9 seconds.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter per second.
1 meter / 1 second = 1 meter
Correct Answer: First convert the total length of the journey from kilometers to meters: 9 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = <<9*1000=9000>>9000 meters
Then divide this by the length of one step to find the number of steps in the journey: 9000 meters / 3 meters/step = <<9000/3=3000>>3000 steps
Then multiply the number of steps by the number of flowers per step to find how many flowers one unicorn creates on the journey: 3000 steps * 4 flowers/step = <<3000*4=12000>>12000 flowers
Then multiply the number of flowers per unicorn by the number of unicorns to find the total number of flowers created: 12000 flowers/unicorn * 6 unicorns = 72,000 flowers

Problem: Hannah is making banana bread. She needs to use 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. It takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush. If Hannah uses 20 bananas, how many cups of flour should she use?
Model Response: 
4 bananas make 1 cup of mush. 20 bananas make 8 cups of mush. So 8 cups of mush = 3 cups of flour.
Correct Answer: First find the number of cups of banana mush Hannah gets: 20 bananas / 4 bananas/cup = <<20/4=5>>5 cups
Then multiply the number of cups of mush by the ratio of flour to mush to find the number of cups of flour: 5 cups mush * 3 cups flour/1 cup mush = <<5*3=15>>15 cups flour

final_answer:  13
Problem: Rick has 130 cards. He decided to only keep 15 cards and so he gave Miguel some of the cards. Then, he saw 8 friends and decided to give them 12 cards each, and the remaining cards were given equally to his 2 sisters. If each of Rick's sisters got 3 cards, how many cards did Rick give to Miguel?
Model Response: 
The number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is 18.
Step 1: Determine the number of cards given to each of Rick's sisters.
The number of cards Rick gave to Miguel is 18.
Step 2: Determine the number of cards Rick gave to his 8 friends.
Step 3: Determine the number of cards Rick gave to his sisters.
The number of cards Rick gave to his sisters is 15.
Step 4: Determine the number of cards Rick kept.
The number of cards Rick kept is 130 - 15 - 8 x 12 = 121.
Step 5: Determine the number of cards Miguel received.
The number of cards Miguel received is 1
Correct Answer: After keeping 15 cards, Rick had 130 cards - 15 cards = 115 cards left.
The total number of cards given by Rick to his 8 friends was 8 friends x 12 cards/friend = <<8*12=96>>96 cards.
There were 2 sisters x 3 cards/sister = <<2*3=6>>6 cards given to Rick's sisters.
So, there were 96 cards + 6 cards = <<96+6=102>>102 cards left after Rick gave Miguel some cards.
Therefore, 115 cards - 102 cards = <<115-102=13>>13 cards were given to Miguel.

Correct Answer: 2 pizzas were ordered and had 12 slices each for a total of 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 slices
Dean ate 1/2 of a 12 sliced pizza so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 slices were left over

Problem: Josh and Anna were both born on August 17th, but in different years. To consolidate celebrations they also got married on August 17 when Josh turned 22. If today they're celebrating 30 years of marriage and their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married, how old was Anna when they got married?
Model Response: 
The 17th of August is a very special day for them.
Correct Answer: We know that Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, therefore he is 30 + 22 = <<30+22=52>>52 years old today
If their current combined age is 5 times the age Josh was when they married (22), then their total combined age is 5 * 22 = <<5*22=110>>110 years
That means that Anna must be 110 - 52 = <<110-52=58>>58 years old today
If they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 58 - 30 = <<58-30=28>>28 years old when they married

Problem: A club opens up and charges $20 to enter.  James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends.  He also buys 6 drinks for himself. Drinks cost $6 each.  He decides to eat some food so he orders some fried chicken which costs $14.  He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders.  How much did he spend for the night?
Model Response: 
Correct Answer: He buys 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 drinks for his friends
So he orders 10+6=<<10+6=16>>16 total drinks.
The cost of the drinks was 16*6=$<<16*6=96>>96
So his order came out to 96+14=$<<96+14=110>>110
The tip came out to 110*.3=$<<110*.3=33>>33
So his order cost 110+33=$<<110+33=143>>143
Adding in the cover charge means it cost 143+20=$<<143+20=163>>163

Correct Answer: If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.
With 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.
If they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.

Problem: Lydia has a small pool she uses to bathe her dogs.  When full, the pool holds 60 gallons of water.  She fills her pool using the garden hose, which provides water at the rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.  Unfortunately, her pool has a small hole that leaks water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.  How long will it take for her to fill the pool, in minutes?
Model Response:  What is the total amount of water she will use to fill the pool?
A)      14 hours
B)      15 hours
C)      16 hours
D)      17 hours
E)      18 hours
The answer is C, 16 hours.
Let's look at the problem:
Let x be the amount of time it takes to fill the pool.
We know that the pool holds 60 gallons of water, so we can say that the pool holds 60 gallons of water.
We know that the pool holds 60 gallons of water, so we can say that the pool holds 60 gallons of water.
We know that the pool holds 
Correct Answer: With a garden hose that fills at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, and a hole that leaks at 0.1 gallons per minute, the net fill rate becomes 1.6-0.1=<<1.6-0.1=1.5>>1.5 gallons per minute.
Therefore, to fill a 60-gallon pool, it will take 60/1.5=<<60/1.5=40>>40 minutes.

Problem: Miss Grayson's class raised $50 for their field trip. Aside from that, each of her students contributed $5 each. There are 20 students in her class, and the cost of the trip is $7 for each student. After all the field trip costs were paid, how much is left in Miss Grayson's class fund?
Model Response: 
The class fund has $120.
The field trip cost $7 per student.
There were 20 students in the class.
The total cost of the field trip was $140.
There was $50 left in the fund after the field trip.
The total amount of money in the fund is $120.
The cost of the field trip is $7.
There are 20 students in the class.
The total cost of the field trip is $140.
The fund has $50 left after the field trip.
The total amount of money in the fund is $120.
Correct Answer: The contribution of the students amounted to $5 x 20 = $<<5*20=100>>100.
So Miss Grayson's class had $100 + $50 = $<<100+50=150>>150 in all.
The cost of the field trip amounted to $7 x 20 = $<<7*20=140>>140.
Therefore, the class of Miss Grayson is left with $150 - $140 = $<<150-140=10>>10.
